This week's project is a clone of [Instagram](http://instagram.com). The goal is to continue to enhance our knowledge of Rails, introduce some more advanced concepts:

* Uploading and processing images using Paperclip, hosting via Amazon S3
* Managing secret information (e.g. private keys)
* Many-to-many relationships in Rails (with tagging)
* Geocoding with Google Maps
* Twitter Bootstrap
* Creating APIs using Rails + [jBuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder)

For this project, we aim be deploying much more regularl - ideally a few times every day.
